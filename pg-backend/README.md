# `pg-backend`

> TODO: description

## Usage

```
const pgBackend = require('pg-backend');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```

# Notes
To make this backend work, you will need to follow quick start guide from YouTube API and get a JSON file called OAuth and download JSON file For Credentials.
Once you have this file, grab `client_secret`, `client_id`, `redirectUrl` (You will see if you have set this up in credentials settings and if you have done it, just grab the first one) 

env variables to set:
```
YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
YOUTUBE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL
```
